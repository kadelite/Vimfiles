Vim's user-specific configuration file is located in the home directory: ~/.vimrc, and Vim files of current user are located inside ~/.vim/. The global configuration file is located at /etc/vimrc. Global Vim files such as defaults.vim and archlinux.vim are located inside /usr/share/vim/.

For gVim, the user-specific configuration file is located at ~/.gvimrc and the global configuration file is located at /etc/gvimrc.


Note:
Commonly expected behavior such as syntax highlighting is enabled in defaults.vim, which is loaded when no ~/.vimrc is present. Add let skip_defaults_vim=1 to /etc/vimrc to disable loading of defaults.vim completely. [1]. Alternatively, to enable defaults.vim even when ~/.vimrc is present, see :h defaults in vim.
gVim loads both Vim's and gVim's configuration file, while Vim only loads Vim's configuration file.

// By default, only English language dictionaries are installed (in /usr/share/vim/vim82/spell/). More dictionaries can be found in the official repositories by searching for vim-spell. Additional dictionaries can be found in the Vim's FTP archive. Additional dictionaries can be put in the folder ~/.vim/spell/ and enabled with the command: :setlocal spell spelllang=en_us (replacing the en_us with the name of the needed dictionary).
